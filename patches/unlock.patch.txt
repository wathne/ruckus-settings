I made the patch myself after inspecting the bash and python code.
The checksum of my patch and the precompiled(ms264556) patch did not match.
The most likely reason for this checksum mismatch is that tar preserves the
"last modified" date and thus the tar binaries will be different.
After decrypting both patches, the internal files have matching checksums.
After re-encrypting both of the decrypted patches, the checksums are again the 
same as before they were decrypted, that is, not matching.
