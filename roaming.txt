IEEE 802.11r, 802.11k and 802.11v are known as the most relevant IEEE 802.11
amendments for roaming. We will use 802.11k and 802.11v, but not 802.11r.

802.11r BSS Fast Transition (FT) and 802.11w Protected Management Frames (PMF)
are known to be incompatible. Additionally, a normal WPA2-Personal handshake
takes about 50ms to complete, which is good enough. 802.11r FT is mainly
beneficial when WPA2-Enterprise authentication is used instead of WPA2-Personal.

802.11v BSS Transition Management (BTM) is enabled by default on Ruckus
Unleashed. They named it Ruckus SmartRoam+, which is confusingly similar to
Ruckus SmartRoam. An 802.11v BTM Request frame is more gentle than an 802.11
Disassociation frame sent by Ruckus SmartRoam. Ruckus SmartRoam is disabled by
default.



Go to https://192.168.10.20 (The IPv4 management interface.)

Admin & Services -> Services -> Radio Control -> Background Scanning:
set 5GHz to enabled

WiFi Networks -> {Name} -> Edit WLAN -> Show Advanced Options -> Radio Control:
enable Background Scanning
enable 802.11k Neighbor-list Report

WiFi Networks -> {Name}-guest -> Edit WLAN -> Show Advanced Options -> Radio Control:
enable Background Scanning
enable 802.11k Neighbor-list Report

Beware that the previous CLI config-wlan settings are automatically wiped after
changing the WLAN settings above. Therefore, the CLI config-wlan settings have
to be set again.
See ./cli-config-wlan.txt
For 5 GHz WLAN, set Protected Management Frames to Required

Login to the Ruckus CLI.
ruckus> en
ruckus# ap-mode

Check that 802.11v BTM is enabled:
ruckus(ap-mode)# get bss-trans-mgmt wlan32
ruckus(ap-mode)# get bss-trans-mgmt wlan33

Check that clients support 802.11v BTM:
ruckus(ap-mode)# get station wlan32 info
ruckus(ap-mode)# get station wlan33 info

Check that Ruckus SmartRoam is disabled:
ruckus(ap-mode)# get roam_enable wlan32
ruckus(ap-mode)# get roam_enable wlan33
